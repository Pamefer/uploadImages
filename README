## What it does?

Is a POST endpoint on NodeJS, that receives an image(The description of the problem was a little confused, so it accepts the image) then is transformed to binary and then is saved on a local server 'static/imagesToQueue'.

It has an aditional feature, it sends to a external server the image uploaded (you have to uncomment the code).
